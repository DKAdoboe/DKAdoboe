# Hey there I am Dela Adoboe

## Who am I?  
From numbers to narratives, I connect the dots—whether it's data, business growth, or self-improvement. Every dataset is a chessboard, and I play to win.

Just a curious mind wandering through the world of data, trying to make sense of all those numbers. If data had a fan club, I'd probably be the vice president.

### A little about me
- I mess around with **Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python** (and somehow make things work!)
- I have a thing for **business development**—because numbers are cool, but strategy is cooler
- Always learning—because knowing stuff is fun
- Hanging out in Ghana, but my Wi-Fi lets me work from anywhere

---

### My (somewhat functional) toolkit
- **Data Analysis:** Excel, Power BI, SQL, Python (yes, sometimes I actually use all of them)
- **Business Intelligence:** Power BI, Tableau (because pretty charts matter)
- **Techy Stuff:** Git, AWS, Azure (still figuring this one out)
- **Other skills:** Breaking down complex things, talking in numbers, making charts look good

### Things I've built (and they actually work!)
- **[Power BI Dashboard - Sales Analysis](#)** - Because businesses love tracking sales
- **[Excel Financial Tracker](#)** - Money management made slightly easier
- **[SQL Data Analysis](#)** - Digging through data like a detective

If you like data, charts, and making sense of chaos, let's work on something cool together!
